# leetcode

## Purpose
To document my thought process with LeetCode problems I come across.

## How to Navigate
All solutions are orgainzed by the programming language used to solve the problem and then by the individual problem title and number.

For example my Python solution to Two Sum would be under
`solutions > python > 1-Two-Sum.md`

### How to read problem
I documented each problem in md files since I could document my thoughts and code in one file.

In the problem I listed:
- Approach
    - My interpretation of the problem and a strategy to solve it
- Code
    - The written solution
- Runtime/Memory
    - The time/space complexity of the solution and with an explanation why that is the case
