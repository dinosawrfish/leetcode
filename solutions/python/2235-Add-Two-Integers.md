## Approach

Jaja, solved this to figure out how LeetCode works.

To get the sum of two numbers, use the `+` python operator.

## Code

``` python

class Solution:
    def sum(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        return num1 + num2

```

## Runtime/Memory

Runtime: O(1) sum operator takes O(1) time

Memory: O(1) only summation is returned
